Well, after 2 weeks of hard work, I have completed the Rails project and I am much more confident in Rails than when I started. Not that I know everything I need to know.  Oh no! However, I know what I don't know,  I know how to look for answers and I know how to ask for help. Those principles are very important in the learning process and I have learned a lot! 

When I started the Rails project, with a list of one hundred requirements (of course I am exaggerating - but that's how I felt), I was overwhelmed, hyperventilating and thinking "What the *&^%* ! " I was sure I would never get it done and I didn't even know how to start. 

 "The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet." - Lao-Tzu.
 
 Isn't that the truth! I forced myself to take a step every time there was failure, fear or frustration. I took 2 steps when there was progress, victory and positive reinforcement. It was probably the most difficult in the beginning because I needed to formulate a process that worked for me. Once I got started, and used the process it made it easier to move along.
 
 TIP:
 
 1.  You must start with a plan. Even if you decide to modify it or scrap it for a new one. You need a road map to work on a project like this. Actually, you should have a road map on any project but definitely on this one. I came up with 7 different ideas and scrapped them all. The eighth plan seemed to fit the project requirements the best so I used it.
 
 2.  Try to use a plan that can be adapted or expanded without much hassle. If you try to think about how you can see the project evolve and the possibilities it will have in the future, it helps with motivation and creative thinking. Who wants to work on something that loses value or is a throwaway? I'm not sure if I will ever get the chance to expand my project but its nice to know that I could if I wanted.
 
 3.  Use the study groups, videos, slack, and all the other resources. I tell you they really helped me figure out a lot of stuff. I spent more time researching and asking questions, than I did actual coding. I'm sure a lot of people did. Once I got the guidance, I was ready to tackle a lot of the problems on my own by trial and error and was surprised that I could find or create (did you get that pun?) what I needed.
 
 4. Check and double check. Use rails console to verify the data you have; use the browser to make sure of RESTful actions and browser issues; use developer tools/inspect element in the browser to see how the views are translating into HTML; use whichever testing system you prefer but use them. 

I look forward to the next step in the curriculum. I am very fond of Javascript and I wonder how it will be applied to Rails and Ruby.
