After so much time working in Ruby and Rails, it was nice to stick my toes back in the JavaScript pool again. However, I did need a bit of refreshing to get my mojo back.

The project as a whole went very well (if I must say so myself). The transition between program languages reminded me of when I went to France with a friend and I had to play translator the entire time for her. It is a skill to be able to quickly move from one language to another and not make grave mistakes. However, it does get you to practice the skills in tandem. 

This project was very much about using different languages and different syntaxes within a language. Not only does the project require a knowledge of Rails, but also at least the basics of  vanilla JavaScript as well as the syntax of jQuery which is a library built with JavaScript. This doesn't include the fact that you have to be familiar with JSON data exchange formats.

I found it enjoyable and challenging. I was able to flex some brain cells and get re-acquainted with JavaScript. I was able to reconfirm that I understand Rails and was pleasantly surprised by the familiarity which came much easier than in previous projects. I was also pleasantly surprised too learn how well JavaScript and Rails can play together. I had a few strange glitches due to the patchwork job that needed to be done, but with a little research I was able to get it together. Yea Google! Yea MDN! Yea Rails Guide! Yea Slack Friends! Most importantly - WOOHOO! to DevTools and console.log()!

Now, I am looking forward to playing with React!
