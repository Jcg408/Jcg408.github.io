There are quite a few moving pieces in the Sinatra Section of the Full Stack Course. Sinatra is a DSL - domain specific language which is built on Ruby. Even though the syntax seems simple, it is still a challenge to learn.

I just finished the Playlister Sinatra lab. This lab consists of building a music playlist application using Sinatra with  ActiveRecord and SQlite. I found it  important to understand the principles of CRUD and RESTful in database applications in order to complete the assignment. 

The most significant aspect of the assignment was using Model, View, Controller in order to build the application.
The separation of concerns concept was introduced to me while studying Front End Development. So, it made a lot of sense to me in the Full Stack progression. 

I also became much more confident in testing my code.  I am better at understanding the errors and better at finding solutions. When I first started this course, I didn't use Pry. I eventually got a better feel for it and learned how it works, and now I always use it. Tux was also instrumental in helping me with this lab.

All in all, it was very educational and I look forward to doing more With Sinatra.
