In my search for mindless entertainment on the television, I came across a documentary about stress and its effects on mental and physical health. This is ironic, since the goal of my search was a break from a stressful coding project. Considering my current situation ( looking for a job in a new career path, running low on funds, imposter syndrome) the stress level is pretty high. I do my best to try and alleviate it by watching mindless nonsensical television (I know, that’s pretty much every show on television), or finding something else to do outside the realm of coding. It’s difficult and I eventually go back to a stressful situation without much relief. 
 
However, I decided to watch and possibly get some more options to try. I was hopeful that one or more of these pointers would be the answer I needed. One of the suggestions was Neurofeedback which seems to be a viable choice if you don't mind wearing a helmet with sensors attached to your head. I declined that option due to cost and wardrobe compatibility. Here are some other options.
 
**Exercise -** I was a professional dancer for decades and exercise was always a part of my life. However, now that I work on a computer, it is difficult to find the energy to get up and do the Mambo. Exercise creates endorphins that improve your mood and are natural painkillers. Exercise also improves sleep quality which is negatively affected by stress. I know, I know - no excuses.
 
**Reduce Caffeine -** Oh no you don’t! You will not touch my coffee!! Generally,  I don’t drink coffee after 12:00pm but, I start my day with coffee and I relish the taste, warmth and comfort of it. Reducing my caffeine would prove to be a stress inducer!
 
**Light a Candle -** Aromatherapy is nice. I like the smell of certain scented candles. If the smell is not so acrid or potent, they  are soothing for a short period of time. For some quick stress relief, with a nice glass of wine - perhaps. 
 
**Write it Down -** One method calls for writing down the things that are stressing you. I am already stressed. Why in the world would I want to see it in writing??! Perhaps if I had a  spell to recite while I burn the paper with a scented candle, I could magic the stress away! Another method is to write down what you are grateful for. I believe keeping track of life’s blessings is a good way to lighten the spirit, so I might give this a try. Does this mean you can use the same piece of paper the next time you get stressed? Or do you have to rewrite it every time? What do you do with all those pieces of paper?
 
**Put on a Fake Smile -** Now, this is interesting. There is a study that shows when you smile through stressful situations, the intensity of the stress reduces. By smiling the brain is tricked into thinking you are happy and in return reduces stress levels. I don’t know if I can do this. I am a *honest feelings* kind of person and this would feel wrong for me,  but hey, there are people in our government who do this everyday!
 
**Look at Fractals -** Fractals are some of the most beautiful and most bizarre geometric shapes.To create a fractal, you can start with a simple pattern and repeat it at smaller scales, again and again, forever. Studies have shown that tracking eye movement and using scans to show the biological response to fractals, have proven that looking at fractals is a good way to relieve stress by as much as 60%. This reminds me of the factorial algorithm and recursion on a hallucinogen - Groovy. 
 
**Meditate -** Research suggests that daily meditation may alter the brain’s neural pathways, making you more resilient to stress. Take time in the day to sit quietly, focusing on a positive thought or mantra, while breathing smoothly and relaxed. Well, I believe this is the winner out of all the previous suggestions. My sister has been meditating for years and she doesn’t seem to be half as stressed as I am. I think it’s time to give it a try.
