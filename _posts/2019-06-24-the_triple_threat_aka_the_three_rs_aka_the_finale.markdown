Today I finished the final project - Rails backend, React frontend with a sprinkling of Redux to spice it up. For a while, I was so confused that I didn't know  up from down. It took longer than I anticipated but there was no other way than to roll up my sleeves and work my way through the coding. 

As a matter of fact, I started out with a plan that was a great idea ( It was going to save the world! I would have won a Nobel Prize!) but then I  I fell down a rabbithole . I had to claw my way back to reality and start over again. I came up with another plan - much simpler, more sedate, not inspiring...... 

Eventually, I had to scratch that one as well because it wasn't me and it didn't inspire me at all. I didn't really care about the subject matter. So, attempt number 3 I decided to work on something I have a passion for and keep it simple with a personal use. I decided the glitz and glamour of multiple functionalities, external visual APIs and spinning images was going to have to wait for another project. I had to conquer the basics of React and Redux in order to get this done.

React has some great advantages: Components hold encapsulated code which make it easier to debug in localized areas, as well as keeping separation of concern throughout the application. The components link and pass props to one another for easy access across the application. It is a JavaScript library which only deals with UI and uses JSX as a way to communicate between JavaScript and the view by way of a  virtual DOM.

Redux works well with React due to its ability to hold state for JavaScript applications. The principles are: 1) A single source of truth- the state for the entire app is stored in an object tree in a single place. 2) State is read only - The only way to change the state is to emit an action. 3) Changes are made with pure functions  - reducers. A pure function's return value is only determined by its input values. State isn't changed, a new state object is returned.

Although the finished product of my project doesn't have bells and whistles and a soundtrack, I was able to learn how the pieces fit together and see the possibilities of expansion. Now that the project has a base, it would not be too difficult to add to it. Who knows? Maybe I will win a Nobel Prize,
