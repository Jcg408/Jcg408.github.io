To tell  you the truth, I'm not a sharing kind of person. I tend to keep my feelings and thoughts to myself unless it pertains to the health and well being of another. I don't use Facebook or Twitter or MySpace. Heck, I barely use Slack and my LinkedIn account is mainly to keep up with business associates and my sister who is a Marketing Master and believes that social networking is vital, and this is the only blog I have.

To the point - I have been reading some of the blogs and newsletters about people in the web dev industry and their paths to success and/or failure. Some have been inspiring, and others doom-gloom ridden but the recurring theme in the stories was the desire to be a part of the industry and the will to keep going. 

I use these stories as my impetus as I continue to go through this course. I am currently working through the SQL/ORM segment and I can't wait to get to Rack, Sinatra, Rails, React, and Redux. I can't wait to form new relatiionships with other languages and frameworks just like I did with Ruby. I never thought that I would be interested in Full Stack development because I was originally smitten with Frond End - the visual lure of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, etc.

I know the challenge at the end of this rainbow of learning is that I actually have to get a job doing this. How in the world is that going to happen? I look at job postings and it seems that most employers are looking for wiz kids with bachelor degrees in computer science and 5 years of experience in the field. I have none of these things but I do have faith and courage and chutzpah so lets just see where it goes.

In the meantime - I'm still here and ready to keep learning and meeting the challenges.
