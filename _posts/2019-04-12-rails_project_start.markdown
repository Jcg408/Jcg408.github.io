Well, here  I am starting another project. Another step towards the goal line. This project is a bit more complicated to me even though Rails is "convention over configuration", I have a hard time with some of the conventions and remembering the little pieces that hold the whole shebang together. 

I started coming up with ideas a week ago for the project, knowing it was coming down the pipeline. I had so many ideas that I wanted to try. Once I read the requirements for the project, and I started to flush them out on paper, they were no longer great ideas. There were some that fit but became overwhelming when I figured out how many classes, controllers, forms, etc they would require. It felt like I was falling through a rabbit hole. I knew I had to scale the whole thing back.

I now have only 2 ideas I am willing to work with. I realize this project will be continued in the Javascript section as well. Maybe I will get a chance to let it bloom into a greater existence then, but for now I believe it best to start simple, clean and logical. Let's see where this takes me - stay tuned.
