Ruby is the latest programming language that I have had the pleasure of meeting. First, there was Python which peaked my interest to delve deeper into software programming. I then turned my attention to Web Development which lead me to HTML, CSS and my love/hate relationship with Javascript. This was a great intro to Front End development but I had little familarity with Full Stack. 

To be honest, after jamming so many things into my brain for Front End, including Bootstrap, Knockout, Jquery......etc, I was fearful I wouldn't be able to learn Full Stack. I really didn't think I **learned** what I needed to move onto anything else. So many moving pieces and I couldn't hold on to one!

Well, here I am learning yet another language -  the infamous Ruby, and what a gem she is!  She (Notice:  I think of it as gender specific) is quite charming in the beginning. Easy syntax which resembles daily logical thought. You want something assigned? Just assign it. You want to something output to screen? Just "puts" it. She is beguiling in her simplicity in the beginning especially for someone who struggled through Javascript with its idiosyncracies.

However, simple doesn't mean easy, does it? I have recently worked my way through enumerations and iterations of nested hashed and was thoroughly flummoxed. There are so many ways to work things in Ruby that it makes it difficult for me to make decisions. If I can't get specs to pass I spend a lot of time revisiting the many methods and enumerators to figure out a solution. 

The challenge for me is to stay true to Ruby by using a simple logical thought process while be able to use the many paths to a solution. It's kind of like Dorothy staying on the yellow brick road when there are so many visual temptations along the way. Poppies.... everywhere!
