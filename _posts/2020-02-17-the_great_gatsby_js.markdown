The Great Gatsby -

Recently, I was asked to create a portfolio website for a client. The portfolio was to be a single page, presentational site. Because I really didn’t have much time to complete the project along with other projects I was already working on, I searched for the best way to accomplish the task. 

Since I have been working in React for the other projects,  I thought it would be nice to stay with the same framework and use React to create the site. When I first started on the project, I realized that using React would be overkill for such a small project. Then, as I was listening to a podcast, I heard about Gatsby. It sounded like a perfect way to work on the project - using React to work on a small project.

So, what is Gatsby? According to gatsbyjs.org  Gatsby is “a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps “.

Gatsby aims to be a Progressive Web App generator that follows the latest web standards. Making use of the latest technologies like Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6, you get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. and it is optimized to be highly performant. There are no reloads between pages when using gatsby-link instead of hyperlinks, and the app still appears smooth and highly performant .

Because Gatsby is built on React, the platform was easy to get started in. Using components and modern ES6 was very comfortable and things got moving fast. Gatsby aims to solve a lot of problems that come time spent on tooling, configuration, and the environment and more time to actually design and develop the site.

Another nice feature - Gatsby can collect your data from wherever it may be. It could be a markdown file, JSON, from your favorite CMS like WordPress,  or third party API and at build time, it will create an internal GraphQL server for the data. All of the data is queried at build time from that same place, in the same way through GraphQL. 

I was also pleasantly surprised to find a trove of documentation for Gatsby. I was able to find all the information I needed to get started on the project. Since it is open source, the content is always up to date.

So, I was able to complete the project within 2 days and not lose time on my other projects. I know I sound like a commercial for Gatsby! Actually, I am a huge fan of React so  Gatsby is a side benefit for smaller projects that can be built quickly and have great performance, with Progressive Web App capability. I recommend checking it out for personal portfolios and small apps.
