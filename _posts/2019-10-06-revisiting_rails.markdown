Lately I have been immersed in all things JavaScript. It kind of makes sense because I started out my journey in Web Development in Front-End. I enjoyed the instant visual gratification from just a minimum of coding with HTML and CSS. It was even more exciting when events and DOM management were accessible with JavaScript. 

It is not the easiest language to learn. It confounded me to no end when I first started learning. The learning process got somewhat better as I progressed but there were still some important quirks that really bothered me. So I made a promise to myself that I was going to spend time and energy and get a grip on this language. As you are probably aware, a lot of  people stumble on the concepts of "this", "hoisting", "scope", and the myriad of idiosyncracies in JavaScript. However, the quirkiness of the language is what really intrigued me. 

Eventually, I decided it was time to go into Full Stack Development. I wanted to understand how things worked under the hood, not just the client side. There seemed to be a whole side of Web Development that I knew little, if anything, about and if I wanted to excel in this field I would need to learn the Back-End.

So, the next language on the list was Ruby. Wow! What a difference. Ruby has a much simpler syntax which makes it easier to understand. As much as JavaScript was confusing because of the complexity, Ruby was confusing because of its simplicity. I learned to deal with the difference and actually enjoyed working in Ruby. The most frustrating part was working with gems.

It was enlightening when I learned Sinatra and even more so with Rails. I enjoyed building applications which had client side and server side elements. I understood CRUD and  REST,  and I followed convention over configuration. Everything made sense.

But, as I mentioned at the start, I have been focused on JavaScript lately. It is the language I am more attached to and it is the language of React and Node.

Today I have decided to take a break from JS and spend some quality time with Ruby. Perhaps a new Rails app would be a nice change of pace.
