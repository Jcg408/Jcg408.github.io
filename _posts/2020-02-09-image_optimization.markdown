A few days ago, my friend asked for my help with her website. She is a non tech person  who decided to try her hand with Wix. She had it up and running but, she was having issues with her images. When I took a look at the site, it was quite obvious that the images needed some TLC. I then explained to her the importance of choosing correct images and optimizing images for web development.

The visual appeal of a web site or app can not be understated. It is important that users are enticed to interact and enjoy the experience. Graphics and images are a good way to relate an idea, tell a story and add visual styling. Just like a printed magazine, you are attracted to certain images that tell a story, or inspire thought. Could you imagine reading a magazine and the pictures are grainy or blurry, or cropped incorrectly, or so small you can't see it? In the garbage it goes.

On average, approximately 66% of a websiteâ€™s weight is comprised of images. If the images are not optimized, you may end up with poor user experience as well as poor site performance. Reducing the size of images without reducing the quality will have a direct and positive impact on page load speeds and user experience.

Using image compression minimizes the size of a graphics file without degrading the quality of the image. With the reduction there is more memory space available for additional images and faster load time.

There are a number of things to consider when optimizing and saving images for the web. File type (JPG, PNG , GIF, SVG) needs to be considered,  depending on the purpose. Image size (pixels, dpi) are also very important factors in optimizing images. 

It is important to  label your images correctly for SEO purposes and save them in the correct color format (sRGB for web). This will help increase the ranking on search engine platforms such as Google, Safari, etc.

There are plenty of sites that offer image compression and optimization [(https://imageoptimizer.in/, https://tinypng.com/, https://imagecompressor.com/)]
If you have a photo editor, then you more than likely have optimization capabilities.
There are so many factors involved in building a visually appealing website. Images and graphics help attract clients, so it is important that they are optimized to enhance the experience without weighing down the site.
