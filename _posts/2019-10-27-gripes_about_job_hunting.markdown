You know something? When I graduated from the Flatiron School, I was so proud of what I achieved! I proved to myself that I could change careers at a later stage in life, I learned so much and felt  like I could conquer the IT world. I was inspired by my schoolmates, instructors and all my IT friends that I took for granted before I graduated. I looked at the world through a nice pair of rose colored glasses. I was in love with tech and I was ready to rumble.

I knew I was ready to join the workforce. I spent the last 4 years learning how to code - first Python, then Front End Web Development, then Full Stack. There was no reason why I couldn't do it.

Except, the glitter has fallen off the disco ball! The interview process has totally deflated my self esteem and made me doubt the decisions I have made. I think I only had 1 interview where I felt as though I was treated like someone who belonged. I still didn't get the job but they weren't half as patronizing as the others. Of course, that was just the first interview! 

At least with a behavioral interview I know what to expect and I can trust myself to present the best 'me' possible.  The technical interviews, on the other hand, are an excercise in humiliation for the interviewee, self-agrandizement for the interviewers, and sometimes pure ridiculousness (is that a word?). The expectations in a tech interview are often not even relevant for the job position. Who came up with using torturous, timed brain teasers to use as a measure of someone's skill level? I have decided that I will never do another Codility test again. I have never felt so nerve racked and unhappy in my life. I will graciously decline the position if that is the method for assessing my worth. It's inhumane!

I used to think Software Engineer and Web Developer were badges of honor. I guess they are when you have been in the business over 5 years . I feel like I have been demoted to less than Junior because you need experience to be considered,  but you can't get the experience unless you get a job, which you won't get because you don't have enough experience......YAAAAAHHHH! How many times have I been rejected from "Entry", "Associate", and "Junior" positions because I don't have the work experience! I have come across TOO MANY job descriptions that have "Junior"  in the  job title but want work experience at 5+ years with Bachelors in CS or Masters (and of course I never finished my Bachelors so another strike against me).  

When I go to meetups or code alongs, the people are always so supportive and encouraging about the field. "There are a lot of jobs out there! You will get one, don't give up". They empathize because they remember what they went through to get a job as well. Yet, the hiring managers, CTOs, Tech directors and those looking to hire, have forgotten and have found many ways to make it very difficult and demoralizing for those entering the field. 

So, if you are reading this and you are in my boat! I feel your pain. Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about it but try to hold onto my dignity as I go through the process. If you are one of the people with the means to make it a little better, try to remember that we are not algorithms, or functions. We are people.
