In my job search as a Software Engineer, I realized the importance to keep up with coding projects and learning new tech but also the need to study for the highly stressful technical interviews. I have been advised to review the most common CS algorithms and theories. In my case, I have  never had a CS class. So, I have been spending my waking hours trying to learn concepts that I have never heard of before and learning a lot of the more common algorithms that a lot of  savvy engineers already know.

Some of the concepts I recently encountered have really been eye openers. One in particular is the 'Greedy Algorithm Method'. This method of solving an algorithm always makes a choice which seems to be the best for that time. When looking at an objective function which needs to be optimized (maximize or minimize) at a certain point, a greedy algorithm will make choices along the way to make sure the optimization occurs. There is one route that is followed step by step with the goal of the optimal solution which means the decisions made are not revisited.

For instance, a request  to -  *Find the minimum sum of  of two arrays of the same size, given that N modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.* is a good example of an algorithm which would benefit from usins a greedy procedure. The optimization of the  objective is finding the minimum sum of 2 arrays. The constraint is N modifications allowed with increase/decrease of 2. A greedy method may start by finding the maximum and reducing it. Choices made along the way involve finding feasible solutions that lead to optimal results.

A greedy result is often not the best solution, but the solution will offer results that are good enough to act as a starting point to other methods. 

As I continue studying the different methodologies for algorithms, I am becoming more aware of ways to look at problems and the different possibilities in solving them. It helps to have perspectives when starting to solve a problem and it definitely helps to know that there is more than one way to approach it.
