Isn't it amazing to be able to find information on virtually everything available on the internet? When you think about it, the subjects are unfathomable and the collective knowledge we can access on a computer is fantastic! Information can be searched in a myriad of languages and returned in seconds. I remember learning about computers in high school and the general thought was "Computers are going to take over the world. They are smarter than people and can do just about everything!"

That was way before I started learning about information technology and how computers work. In reality, the only language a computer understands is extremely simple. Machine language consists of binary bits designated with 
'0' and '1' which represent electric impulses for on and off. Obviously, there is a bit more to it than that but the gist is that computers really don't understand any other language but machine language. All other languages must be compiled and translated into machine language before the computer can do anything with it.

Just as there are various programming languages, there are a variety of compilers to handle the different languages. Some languages only require one pass through the compiler for the translation to be done. Others may take two to three passes to complete translation. Often, this is due to the construct and complexity of the programming language. Taking in consideration, the CPU speed, the operating system and other performance factors, it is truly amazing that response time is measured in seconds. 

Imagine the millions of processes occuring at any time. Computers processing tons of data just using '0' and '1'. Although, most computer savvy people may take this for granted, I would imagine that for someone just encountering a computer, it seems magical.  I did peek behind the curtain,  but  I am sure there is still a wizard there somewhere!
