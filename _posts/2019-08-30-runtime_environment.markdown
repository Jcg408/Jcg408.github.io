What is a runtime environment?


In order for a program to execute it needs an environment in which to operate. It needs access to resident memory and resources such as files, sockets, etc. The runtime environment supplies services and processes for the application to run.

Think of it this way - 

**Planet runtime environment -** In order to survive, plants and animals need certain elements for life and propogation.  The planet provides an environment which provides vital elements for the race to survive. We have air, minerals, water, fire, etc. Without these elements we can't sustain life.

**Aquatic runtime environment -** In order for aquatic plants and animals to function, they rely on the water environment to provide certain elements for their survival. Without these elements these plants and animals would not survive. 

So, it only makes sense that applications and programs have an environment as well. They need to have an environment which can help sustain them and supply services and dependencies for them to run. 

The operating system provides a runtime environment as an execution environment. It provides a state for an application to access libraries, system variables and environment variables. 

So, think of it as the air that your application is breathing, and the food that it is eating. Ok - thats going a bit far, but
it does offer a different perspective.
