When I started my job search I noticed certain buzzwords that I was not familiar with. One such term is "Agile". Now to me, the dancer, agile means quick to respond with the ability to adapt to different conditions. Limber, light-footed and graceful. I didn't realize it had a special meaning in software development where it is all the rage these days.

I remember when I first interviewed as a  software engineer and one of the questions from the interviewer was "Have you  ever worked on an "Agile" team?". Of course, I heard the words "agile team"  and remembered  my dance experience. I didn't think the interviewer was asking about being physically agile. I chose to ask further clarifying questions and found out they meant a development methodology. Obviously, the answer was no and as you can see I didn't get the job. However, it peaked my curiosity and I researched the topic to prevent looking like a fool at the next interview.

I understand why the word  "agile" was chosen as the name, since the principles pertain to being able to adapt to changes quickly, working in incremental stages to facilitate changes, and collaborating in smaller cross functional teams. The methodology is supposed to make the process of implementation easier and more productive. There is a focus on team and client collaboration during all the stages, and an incremental, iterative process.
 
 Although it is the most popular methodology these days, there seems to be some dispute on whether it is as wonderful as some people think. 
 
 Because the work is done in small increments, the finished product is not available at time of implementation. This requires frequent testing and refactoring or changing before moving to the next phase. It has been noted that the Agile methodology is often not the best approach for large organizations and has been criticized for being too extreme. Depending on who you ask or what you read, there are pros and cons for its use. Yet, it does seem the be all the rage these days.
 
At least, the next time I have the question about Agile Software Development, I will be able to reply  and hold a conversation in the topic. I may still not get the job, but at least I can talk "agile".
