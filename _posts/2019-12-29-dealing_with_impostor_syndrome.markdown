“I have written 11 books, but each time I think, ‘Uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find me out.’”   — Maya Angelou

"When I wake up in the morning, I feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl. But I say, '*****, you're Lady Gaga, you better ******* get up and walk the walk today ...'" — Lady Gaga

People from all walks of life deal with impostor syndrome. It's that self-debilitating feeling that you are not good enough and that you might be in over your head. That you really aren’t as good at your job as everyone believes or you're not really deserving of the position you find yourself in. You are waiting for the day they discover you’re a fraud. How could they not have seen it earlier?

It’s something that many people deal with on a daily basis. The syndrome, which was formally named by American psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes in 1978, is defined by its creators as "a feeling of phoniness in people who believe that they are not intelligent, capable, or creative, despite evidence of high achievement,"

Why do we feel this way?   It is a culmination of different psychological and sociological factors. It can stem from a deep sense of humility, a strong desire to gain acceptance, peer pressure, striving for perfection, rivalry, jealousy, and other human ego frailties.  Impostor syndrome can lead to a paralyzing fear, or severe depression. 

It’s so easy for us to compare ourselves to others. Competition and comparison can be a motivating factor but can also foster jealousy and insecurity. Just because peers may seem to be more gifted, or seem smarter doesn’t mean they actually are. Try to measure yourself against yourself, not others. 
Remember - you are not the only ‘impostor’ in the room. Most people feel it but don’t want to admit it. I have started a new technique. I will write a big note and place it on my computer screen - ‘Keep Calm and Impostor On!’ or ‘Respected Member of the Impostor Club’. They help me to acknowledge the feeling  and remind me that I am not the only one feeling this way.

It’s also very important to be gracious of compliments and accolades. No one likes a braggart or egotistical prat but when someone offers a positive comment, say ‘thank you’ and accept the warm fuzzy that goes with it. When you do something you are proud of, learn to thank yourself in some fashion. Accept gratitude and give gratitude.
Failure is a stepping stone to success. As Winston Churchill said "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”  We tend to notice successful people for their wins, the money, the awards, etc. We rarely hear about the many failures they experience before they break through. We need to be proud of the struggles as well as the resolutions.
Learn to rely on your friends, family, cohorts, support groups to be a sounding board or a great reality checker. Holding your feelings in will allow them to deepen and fester. Find someone to talk to - even your pet. Often, when we hear ourselves talking about it out loud, we are able to work through it. 
So, next time that panicky sinking feeling hits, know that I am also dealing with that demon - ‘Get thee behind me, Satan!”
