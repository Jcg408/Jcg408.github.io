I just finished the OO Student Scraper project and it was surprisingly satisfying! It reminded me of famous Agatha Christie detectives like Mrs Marples or Monsieur Poirot! The looking for clues, the tracking of suspects - keeping track of bits of information to build the case, discarding information which doesn't fit and checking alibis.... I digress but you get the point, right? Investigating HTML code for clues to where the information exists, using specific CSS selectors to hone in on specific areas and gather bits of evidence, saving the data and collecting it for future use..  

However, there is concern, and rightly so, about the data that is collected. There are ethical and professional concerns about the right to take information from a website. I am not an expert in corporate regulations or corporate intelligence,  but I have to admit it seems to be a form of hacking. Yet, I believe it is a great benefit to be able to gather information from a variety of sources without the intent of profiteering and thievery. 

Enough of the moral, ethical rant. Technically, I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of scraping. It was actually fun!  It takes patience, curiosity, stubborn determination and digging through the code to find some interesting and useful information. The pursuit of hidden clues is like sleuthing and The "AHA!" moments are very satisfying.
