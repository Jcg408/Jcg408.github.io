I finished the Sinatra MVC Travel Log project today. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed putting it together.  I originally thought I would be frustrated and confused with so much to keep in mind.  Literally I went to bed with "Sinatra, MVC, CRUD, RESTful,  Rake, Pry, Get, Post, Patch, Delete, etc.." running through my brain. However, once I came up with a plan and mapped it out on paper I was ready to go.


I found that using pencil and paper helped me to sketch the logic of what I wanted and where I needed to go. It helped my mind stay focused on one procedure at a time and work my way from one route or page to the next.
One day I was working remotely and I forgot my notes and I didn't have a pencil or paper. I found that my mind would skip ahead to another point of concern and I would mess up the point that I needed to focus on. I learned my lesson that day. When you have files interacting through Model, View, Controller and also have to maintain persisted data that is correct, there must be a system to keep your ducks in a row.

I enjoyed working with Sinatra. This project was like a puzzle game and I love puzzles. My finished project is not the most visually stunning piece of work but I have a solid understanding of MVC, CRUD, REST and Sinatra. I plan on adding some more functionality to it once I have the time.
