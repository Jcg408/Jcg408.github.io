SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL originated in the  1970s, when IBM laboratories created a new database software named  System R. SEQUEL was the language created to manage the data. Later it was shortened to SQL. 
SQL has become a database query language standard which is certified by ANSI and ISO. It is the language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. There are various popular open-source SQL database platforms such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQlite and Firebird which have helped to promote the use of SQL and relational databases.
A relational database is a database that allows users to set up connections or relationships between data records, and to use those connections to view and manage data.  Relational databases store data in tables. A table consists of rows and columns. Rows represent an entity and columns represent the attributes of entities. 

A benefit of using relational databases is the ability to organize large amounts of data. Relational databases use multiple tables when defining separate types of data, unlike other databases. Relationships between specific data points in the tables are linked by defining that relationship.
This helps to create a systematic and distinct view of data without repetition. The databases are flexible and scalable due to the ease of adding, changing and removing data.

NoSQL (non relational)
NoSQL is a type of database system that doesn’t use a tabular relational database method and does not use SQL to query data. These types of databases have been around since the 1960’s but have grown in popularity in the past decade. NoSQL is typically used for very large databases, which can’t be handled by SQL due to the limitations in the relational database design. It is also possible to cluster data into several machines to reduce maintenance cost.

There are various types of NoSQL database platforms such as:
Document oriented databases – Store, retrieve and manage dynamic data. Also known as semi-structured data. Examples: MongoDB and CouchDB
Column databases (also known as wide-column stores)  – stores data as sections of columns. This is useful in data analytics. Examples: HBase and BigTable
Key value stored databases – Fast and are not very customizable. Examples: Cassandra and BerkeleyDB
Cache databases – Store data into the disk or the cache. Example:  Memcache
Graph databases – these databases are designed for data whose relations are well represented as a graph. Examples: Oracle NoSQL and Neo4J.
The benefit of using NoSQL database is evident when working with ‘Big Data’. NoSQL database environments are built with a distributed architecture so there are no single points of failure. There is also a built-in redundancy of both function and data. So, If one or more database servers fail, the other servers in the system are able to continue with no loss of data. This is beneficial to companies who need to update or make changes to the system, while still having the ability to service customers with no down time.
Summary
As you can see, there is a definite difference between the two systems and yet they both have benefits depending on the application. Relational databases have a structure which is flexible in managing and changing the data and it has a language which is standardized and is great for querying and analyzing data. NoSQL databases are good for very large amounts of data. They reduce latency and have a distributed architecture to eliminate single points of failure and loss of data.
