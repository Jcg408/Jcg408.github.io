I'm sure I'm not alone in the experience of self-doubt and fear of the unknown. I try to focus on the goal ahead and keep a positive, motivated outlook but sometimes the little voices take over and pull me back... Those subliminal self destructive traps that undermine your courage and determination.

I have been plugging away diligently on the Online Immersive Full Stack course with a goal to finish in 6-7 months. I was  unemployed for a quite a while and without the prospect of a new job, I decided to change careers. I have often dreamed of being a successful web developer and always found excuses not to follow the path... until I was unemployed. So, I decided to take the leap and invest in myself.

Sometimes, we can be our own worst enemy. Everyone else can believe in you, but it doesn't mean anything unless you can believe in yourself. I am at a point in the course when reality is starting to sink in. I am amazed at how much I have learned. I knew a bit before but this course is really filling in the gaps and introducing concepts I have never had. However, there is still so much more to learn. So, I catch myself thinking "What in the world do you think you are doing?! You will never be ready to get a job in this field! You are not good enough!" Then, I take a deep breath, listen to some Brahms and think "Get a grip, girl! You can do this! You have to do this! Don't let the bad vibes get you down! Keep your eye on the prize! You will succeed!".

I realize that everyone lives with some doubt and fear. I just can't let it rule my life. I love coding and I enjoy working with  broken code, like a puzzle. So, my mantra is - "ain't nothin' gonna break my stride!".
