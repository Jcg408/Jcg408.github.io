Because anxiety and the stress of job hunting has taken a toll on me for the past 4 months, I decided to treat myself to some holiday recuperation. Before last week, I  dedicated quite a number of hours every day working on boosting my knowledge and confidence, in preparation for the next job interview when it comes.

I found some interviewers were keen on testing, so I have been cramming on testing, JS and Ruby. Then there are interviewers looking for SQL so, I had to review the SQL queries. What about the Front End interviewer who asked questions about HTML and CSS? It had been a while, so I had to brush up on that as well. Of course, I am also working on a new MERN project so I needed to really understand Node and Express. Not to mention, I still don’t understand why I am having issues with blasted Heroku!

So, I took some days off last week for the holiday. Wednesday - I had some DIY projects to do in the house and start prepping some dishes for Thursday. I didn’t do a lick of coding. It felt really strange, like a voice from the computer kept calling my name and beckoning me to play. 

Thursday - Thanksgiving Day. There were only two of us for dinner but I still spent the day in the kitchen cooking and baking and watching Poirot, Miss Marple, and other favorite shows. At one point I went to the computer to do a bit of work, but my sister just about had a fit so I had to surrender to her wishes.

Friday - I actually slept a bit later than usual. Ok, so it was only a half hour, but it was nice. I spent the day watching movies with the family and eating leftover turkey and having cocktails. Then we went to dinner - enough with turkey! When I returned home, I tried valiantly to do some studying, but I started to fall asleep and couldn’t focus so I just went to bed.

Saturday morning - I got up bright and early, got coffee and went to the computer. I felt refreshed and eager to get started. I was able to prioritize my assignments, stay engaged with the learning process and actually felt good about the accomplishments I made that day. Amazingly, Node and Express seemed much clearer than the last time I looked at them, and I remembered much more HTML, CSS and SQL than I thought I would. Although, I still don’t know why I can’t get Heroku (!@#%^!) to work, I'm sure someday I will figure it out.
Hopefully, this good mojo will follow me in the interviews I have scheduled next week.
