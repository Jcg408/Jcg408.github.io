I have recently been working on Classes, Class Methods, Instance Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Scope in Ruby. Add to this the principles of DRY and Abstraction. I enjoy working in Ruby but sometimes all the specifics are mind boggling. So, for further clarification and samples where does one go? **GOOGLE**!

There are **SOOOO** many resources on Ruby out there that you need hours to sift through what qualifies as relevant.
Sometimes, this results in more questions instead of the answer you were looking for. Of course, "ruby-doc.org", "ruby-lang.org" and "Wikibooks - Ruby Programming" are good sources with accurate and precise information. However, they tend to be too pedantic for me. I come from an artistic background so the more visual and relatable the explanation - the better for learning. If the project isn't clearly explained (Where are we going? What is expected to be found once we arrive? What is the method of transportation? What do we do if we don't get the result we expected?), my brain becomes fuzzy, I lose interest and want to quit.

I recommend the video sessions with Avi Flombaum because he tends to break the process down to simple bite size chunks with explanations along the way. One of my favorites is  Advanced OO - Feb 13. However, there doesn't seem to be very many. I would recommend that Flatiron create a library for students with these videos so we can access them easily. I have also found "ruby-for-beginners" at rubymonstas.org, "What is Ruby - rubyist.net",  and "Programming Ruby" at ruby-doc.org to be quite helpful with common language explanations. 

In all of my years as a coach and teacher I have always found a way to relate the learning process to an everyday part of a student's life. No matter the age, gender, or ability, there are situations which they can put themselves in which help them to overcome an obstacle. If there is a way for a person to relate to a concept it  will be easier for them to work with the concept. If building Classes can be related to everyday common occurrences (babies, music, dogs, cats, co-workers, grocery store, library, vacations etc.) the process of working through a problem and fitting the pieces together will be  much more constructive. Yet, when you *"talk in program speak"*  it is harder to relate which leads to loss of interest and frustration. I understand the need for programming vernacular in the industry but can't we keep it simple and relatable in the learning phase?
