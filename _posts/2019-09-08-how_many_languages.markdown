Recently I read an article which quoted a tech entrepreneur who has special questions he likes to ask potential hires in the final round of interviews. One of his questions is " Rate your knowledge of technology trends on a scale of 1 to 10".
If the answer is 9 or 10  its an instant red flag. His reasoning is that no one is an expert in technology trends. You may be an expert in some things but not every thing and the trends change so quickly there is no way to know what is going to trend in the tech industry. No one knows whats going to happen.

Heck, I can't keep up with fashion trends let alone tech trends! I don't know how one becomes an expert when there is always something new to add to the pile. 

When I first started out, I learned Python. I then went on to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby not to mention having to learn the frameworks and libraries that go with them. I thought well this is good - I can really sink my teeth into this repertoire and that should be it.

But that isn't what happens is it? Especially when you are new to the industry and you are still trying to figure out where you fit in the job market. You want to appeal to as many employers as possible so you decide you have to try and keep up with the trends. Maybe you should add another framework or library, maybe start learning another language.

You're like a kid in a candy store. You want some of the gummi bears, cinnamon drops, licorice, watermelon .... There is no end to the variety and you can't eat them all. You have to make a decision! 

Did you know that there are over 700 programming languages? (Krypton? Hollywood? Emerald?) Now, obviously some of them are defunct and some very rarely if ever used however, there are still hundreds that are used on a daily basis.

I remember watching a Bob Martin video as he bemoaned the fact that there is a ridiculous amount of languages out there. Why do we need so many languages? It becomes a trend - the next *Super Program* and companies change their system because they believe it will solve all of the problems that the old system had. Instead, it brings another set of new problems.

So, with all this in mind. I have made a decision to get better with the tech I already feel good about and add the MERN stack with Jest unit testing. That should give me more than enough to work on...... for now.
